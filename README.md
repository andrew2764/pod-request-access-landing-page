## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development
First challenge where I dealt with a lot of responsive images, and I did some CSS gymnastics to make them work.
For example, this project uses three images in the background for different screen sizes. I handled this case by simply having three html image tags and using the css property `display: none` according to their respective screen sizes.


```html
<div class="image-host">
  <img class="image-host-sm" src="./assets/mobile/image-host.jpg" alt="">
  <img class="image-host-md" src="./assets/tablet/image-host.jpg" alt="">
  <img class="image-host-lg" src="./assets/desktop/image-host.jpg" alt="">
</div>
```
```css
.image-host-sm {
  min-height: 100%;
  min-width: 100%;
}

.image-host-md,
.image-host-lg {
  display: none;
}
...
...

@media (min-width: 600px) {
  .image-host-sm {
    display: none;
  }

  .image-host-md {
    display: block;
    min-width: 100%;
    min-height: 100%;
  }
  ...
}

@media (min-width: 1000px) {
  .image-host-md {
    display: none;
  }

  .image-host-lg {
    display: block;
    min-width: 100%;
    min-height: 100%;
  }
  ...
}
```

I used this same approach in two other cases where an element is in one place in small screen sizes but in another in larger screen sizes. I don't yet know if this is a good idea but I'll see how other people handle this same scenario.
